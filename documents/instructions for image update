# Instructions for Updating Code with Your Own Images

These instructions will guide you through the process of replacing the default images in the code with your own images.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Images

1. **Image Requirements:** Ensure your images meet the format and size requirements specified by the code (if any).

2. **Naming Convention:** If the code references specific image filenames, make sure your images are named accordingly for easy replacement.

## Step 2: Replace Images in the Code

1. **Locate Image References:** Open the code files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) where images are referenced or used.

2. **Update Image URLs:**
   - Replace existing image URLs with the URLs or paths to your own images.
   - If using local files, ensure the paths are correct relative to the code file's location.

### Example (HTML):

```html
<img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Your Image">
